# exiftool-QC
A simple Windows batch script that utilises ExifTool to read metadata from files and generate a CSV export for quality control purposes.

## Requirements
1. A computer running a Windows operating system. This was created and tested on Windows 10
2. ExifTool by Phil Harvey, available from https://www.exiftool.org/. Follow the Windows install instructions for use on the command line
***Note:*** If you cannot move the executable to C:\WINDOWS due to user right restrictions, you can update the batch script to refer to the location of the executable instead
